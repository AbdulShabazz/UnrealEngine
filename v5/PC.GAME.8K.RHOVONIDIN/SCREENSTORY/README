Equipment is LOWERED out of the X-Class INTO the heart of the walled metropolis
An exterior barrier OPENS on the deck of the ship, and Hennethica STROLLS out onto the landing deck.
Wearing a shawl across his face, he admires the bustling city, the island, and the sunrise...
General Agrippa appears at his side.

HENNETHICA
Tell me this is the beginning of a dream!

He rubs his stomach, wishful... General Agrippa REGARDS him.

AGRIPPA
It is a Spartan ViewI (then)
We will mold the world to our liking; building it and shaping it, as we see fit. It will indeed be the beginning, and the realization
of our dreams. We will gather the tech that we need.

HENNETHICA
Indeed, this is a place... for a king!
And his Queen! 

Agrippa smiles.

HENNETHICA
Vice Lieutenant Sheeran -- He will try to stop us.

AGRIPPA
He is a foolish military officer. A politician.

HENNETHICA
But not a man to be taken lightly on the battlefield...
Once a commander of ten thousand generals. Including you.

The words sting. But Agrippa CONCEDES his friend's assertion.

AGRIPPA
Leave Federation Vice Lieutenant Sheeran to me.

BIG_EVENT [3.1.2] He retakes a military base

EXT. THE WESTERN EVERGREEN FOREST - DAY

Kayman stands before several battalions of Agrippa's most hardened forces.
He notices men in stealth-covered uniforms, creeping inside the perimeter! He points, concerned! --
An explosion rocks the base!
The entire battalion turns and they focus on Kayman, expectant!!!
Kayman then SENSES Lieutenant Sheeran standing behind, aiming his weapon at his head!
As tall as Kayman is, the 7'2", lieutenant Sheeran still TOWERS over him!
He turns to address this infiltrator with a swift kick, which Lieutenant Sheeran blocks with a high-knee.
He then draws his sword in a punching motion, at Lieutenant Sheeran --which he also blocks, maintaining his aim - - remaining steady, on Kayman.
Kayman regards him, stunned Lieutenant Sheeran fires.
Kayman's body SLUMPS to the ground.
Stunned, the entire battalion raise their hands, in surrender!
Lieutenant Sheeran steps forward, in full view, before the entirety of the many Shard battalions.
Silent, and glowering.
Federation troops swarm the basel They outnumber the Shard, TWENTY-to-ONE!
A Federation soldier, CAPTAIN ZARGIEFFE, approaches Sheeran.

ZARGIEFFE
Sir, our intel was wrong; he isn't here!

He turns to his second-in-command, Kawamura.

SHEERAN
(Soto) Find me the whereabouts of General Agrippa!

INT. THE WALLED METROPOLIS - COMMAND CENTER - DAY

Ericmain gains General Agrippa's attention.

ERICMAIN
Sir, we've lost communications with forward operations command.

Agrippa purses his lips, in concern!

AGRIPPA
You are unable to reach officer John Kayman??

A FEDERATION COUNCILMAN adressess Sheeran, from a video monitor, in the background.

COUNCILMAN
(Sing-song) How are things Rhaimis??

Lieutenant Sheeran grimaces.

SHEERAN
(Sing-song) Fine, Councilman!
(then)
The first name is Peter.

COUNCILMAN
I've been busy, lately, I'm sure you have too, Rhaimis!
Among other things, the Federation is set to consider Resolution F-One-Ninety-Two, which pertains to next year's military budget!

SHEERAN
Yes. And my pension, as well!

COUNCILMAN
I did not know that! Really?? So if the resolution doesn't pass, I suppose you're right: there will be no money in the budget for your pension.
I assure you its just a coincidence I'm contacting you, on the same day, to evaluate the way the campaign is going.--

SHEERAN
--Yes, a coincidence, Indeed.

COUNCILMAN
Peter, I know you'd prefer to have an unlimited budget, and for our government to stay out of your way
and my superiors on this council have afforded that to you, for some reason; they must be crazy. But I consider myself more on top of things: Although a number of your operations are classified, due to national security -- You will still have to explain yourself, under oath, and risk of imprisonment, at the final hearings. Especially if the Federation is less than happy with your progress.

SHEERAN
I'm making personnel changes, as we speak. It'll all be in my written battle assessment report.

--Sheeran raises and then lowers his hand. The men, in the background, do nothing.
The monitor cuts out!
Frustrated, Sheeran studies 3D maps of his war progress.

SHEERAN
(Mutters) Just in time for you re-election!

--A shot RINGS out, in the background! POP| Sheeran doesn't flinch, as a Federation soldier unchambers a round from his weapon, executing a fellow, tattered and beaten Federation soldier. Other soldiers gasp and moan!

SHEERAN
Why are my battalions trekking through the Swat Valley, to The Northern Shore?!
It's a goddamn savannah!

Sheeran's eyes dart, looking for the one, responsible.
Selfish Captain, in the background, attempts to hide from view
Another captain approaches Sheeran, and offers him a cipboard!

SHEERAN
Gimmie that.

Sheeran SNAPS up the clipboard and signs the paperwork. He tosses the clipboard back to him.
Another shot RINGS out.
Sheeran, then faces the Shard prisoner, seated before him. The man's face - - spattered with bruises.
ShadowCaster now stands just behind Sheeran.

SHEERAN
Shard scum! You have information I need! And you're going to give it to me.

The nervous Shard prisoner studies Sheeran.

SHEERAN
(Scowl) You are aware you're in dangerous territory?

The Shard prisoner balks, then REALIZES the heiress, ShadowCaster, in present company.
Sheeran's eyes NARROW, CURIOUS, as any and all signs of fear flow AWAY from the man's face.
// Lance (capturedI) is brought to Sheeran //
The soldiers around Sheeran grow nervous.
Sheeran steps away, and whispers, in anger, into a fellow captain's ear.
Lance enters, through the ante-room, escorted by PROUD AMBASSADOR!

PROUD AMBASSADOR
I'm hoping this Shard run-in, with The Federation, can be resolved.
(then)
You were a slave; not a natural born, free -- but a prisoner.
Do you care that our side wins this war?

LANCE
I only want the war to end.

The ambassdor SHUDDERS, at Lance's treacherous words!
The ambassdor then notices Sheeran, close - and with THE CAPTAIN - both fast-approaching.
Before he can muster the courage to speak - - the captain nudges between them, beckoning Lance in the direction of the Ileutenant!

CAPTAIN
You! This way!

They APPROACH Vice Lieutenant Sheeran.

CAPTAIN
Vice Lieutenant Sheeran, Sir, this is Lance - - the leader of The Remnant-Federation.

Sheeran raises and then lowers his hand. The men, in the background, do nothing.
Sheeran SCRUTINIZES him -- without a proper uniform, or any rank.

SHEERAN
Mmm...

POP! A guard in the background RAISES his rifle and EMPTIES a round INTO ShadowCaster!
ShadowCaster's lifeless body FLOPS to the ground.
Sheeran doesn't flinch; he CONTINUES now to EYE Lance.
Lance STRUGGLES to keep his composure.

SHEERAN
This location is classified; detain him, immediately, and process him on a Section Eight violation!
Sheeran indicates a blood-stained, bullet-ridden wall, rife with tiny bits of flesh.
The captain ADMONISHES.

CAPTAIN
Sir, this is Lance Rhovonidin -- the leader of the Federation-Remnant!!

SHEERAN
--Ah! ...AHH! Lance Rhovonidin! ...Yes

Sheeran eyes him, deeply, DISAPPOINTED.
He BECKONS Lance follow him toward a staffing table.
Sheeran exchanges a hidden look with his cartographer, over at the mapping table.

SHEERAN
I take it must have taken you a while out of you way to reach here, after that bastard Agrippa dropped you out of his ship??

LANCE
No. Not Really.

SHEERAN
Possibly a few hours, maybe??

LANCE
Maybe an hour, perhaps; possibly forty minutes!!

Sheeran turns in a quiet manner to the cartographer.

SHEERAN
Map every location within an hour of this location; I want to know the location of that X-Fighter!

He returns his attention to Lance.

SHEERAN
I take it you don't dwell too much in the how- or why- of a matter?
Such little things, as they are!

Sheeran LEERS, to assure NOONE else is listening.

SHEERAN
You seem like a goals-oriented man to me.
Lance's eyes WIDEN as Lt.Sheeran beckons him to glimpse THE KRAKEN MEDALLION, on a nearby table.

Sheeran now faces Lance, in a direct manner.

LANCE
I will find general Agrippa, and vanquish his armies.
Agrippa will surrender the crown, and then kneel before me!!

Sheeran raises and then lowers his hand. The men, in the background, do nothing.
Sheeran sneaks a glance and looks Lance over, once more.
As Tall as Lance is, and as fit as he is -- Sheeran is taller and more fit.
Lance tries to hide his intimidation.

SHEERAN
(Doubtful, Dubious) Of course!!

They stroll back toward the ante-room. Sheeran hands Lance a map of the area.

SHEERAN
The General's time has come and gone! If you could alleviate this...small-but-very-large-problem for me, would be much appreciated. --

Another SHOT rings out, and Selfish Captain's body falls, to the floor.

Sheeran PROFFERS the medallion to Lance! Lance accepts the medallion, and exits.

Sheeran's eyes NARROW.

Sheeran raises his weapon and FIRES 2 rounds INTO the captive! 

Sheeran's men GASP and separate from the now-wounded and bleeding man, stunned!

Sheeran steps away from view.

SHEERAN
(O.S.) Release him! Let's see if our new bait can lure a worthy prey!

// The fleeing wounded captive, cries out, trying to lure Shard rebels 

INT. THE WALLED METROPOLIS - COMMAND CENTER - DAY

Ericmain gains general Agrippa's attention.

ERICAIN
Sir, First Captain's tracking beacon just went off-grid.

They exchange saddened looks. Agrippa nods, with understanding.

ERICMAIN
Lieutenant Sheeran...is a madman, sir. He's... -- He's got to be stopped.

Downtrodden, Agrippa, exits.

IN HIS OFFICER QUARTERS

Agrippa GAZES out of his picture window, into the starship hangar, witnessing the funeral of officer Kayman...

Agrippa seats himself at his desk, reminiscing over a photo of him and ShadowCaster.

Dr. Meade's lab has a massive picture window, overlooking the entire Evergreen forest, and The walled Metropolis, off in the distance.
Dr. Meade and Agrippa saunter through the new research lab.
Fellow Shard soldiers haul in lab equipment!
A group of Shard soldiers tote in a cryogenic casket!
SEVEN Shard soldier's on each side of it, STRUGGLE to tote the large sarcophagus into the room!
It attracts General Agrippa's attention.
They park the sarcophagus in front of him. He examines the LED readouts, on its side, and then by himself, HEAVES the lid offl The lid THOOMS onto the floor!
General Agrippa PEERS inside...I
An Ibra-lim lays, isolated and shifting, within the glass chamber. Its eyes and ears shielded and covered

AGRIPPA
What did you do to him??

Agrippa readies to press a switch, to open the lid, Dr. Meade beckons his hand away

DR. MEADE
You must be careful!
The Ibra-lim are very sensitive.
You must expose them only to your target.

Dr. Meade beckons him to a secluded COMPUTING AREA, across the main room.
Agrippa, nods, and pulls aside a young guard, CALIDAN.

AGRIPPA
I want fifty of my strongest guards with Dr. Meade at all times, when he's outside of The walled Metropolis, and at The UltraDam!

CALIDAN
The Sh'Nho'Din?! Right away, sir!

The ghost of Tellumus WATCHES them, from behind a cabinet.

LANCE
Tellumus! How are you old friend?!

TELLUMUS
You're happy to see me?

LANCE
You give me hope, old friend!

TELLUMUS
Hope... ? In what way? For what??

They exchange looks.

LANCE
(Digressive) Never mind!

TELLUMUS
Lance, you must not go to the UtraDam.
General Agrippa is there, developing a new weapon.

LANCE
what do they intend to do with it?

TELLUMUS
The new mathematics they've developed enables them to reason over semantic imprints;
The mathematics and the semantic imprint are combined, into a quantum software.
It is an imprint, that they need!
General Agrippa has converted a few of his men into Remote Viewers -- the Ibra-lim. Through torture.
He intends to use them to extract a semantic imprint from you, and deliver it to Dr. Meade.

LANCE
Dr. Meade... How did you find this out?

TELLUMUS
Lance, They intend to use the semantic imprint to derive a quantum model to predict you!
You must not go. If you do, you will likely be confronted by one of his Remote Viewers.

Lance ponders his words.

LANCE
Well, if he has developed such a quantum weapon, there is nothing I can do now. He must be stopped.

TELLUMUS
But everything you do once you are in his presence ~-every decision you make - could be a part of his plan!

LANCE
Thank you, my friend! I understand.

He is undeterred, as they exchange looks.

TELLUMUS
Then -- allow me to help!!

They exchange smiles. Lance jets out of the caves, with Tellumus right behind

HENNETHICA
(Nods) I'll do whatever is needed of me!

DR. MEADE
I require a volunteer, Hennethical Someone pure of heart!
For my most dangerous experiment!
We've reached a very important point;
the war is turning.--

HENNETHICA
Me?!

DR. MEADE
You are the reason we are here, are you not??
Agrippa nods!

HENNETHICA
What do I do with it?

DR. MEADE
You must drink itl And you will bear a child--

Hennethica EMBRACES him, in his surprise and they KISS!
Hennethica exits, with potion, in-hand!

DR. MEADE
(Cont'd, to Agrippa) A very special child. A girl! If any of us should fall, by an enemy hand, she will grow stronger! And in the day all of us fall, she will acquire the ability to revive, each and every one of us... as pure energy!

IN THE GRAND CORRIDOR

Hennethica HURRIES down the corridor, in HIGH spirits.

IN THE QUEEN'S QUARTERS

Hennethica approaches the bureau and SELECTS the best makeup, and powder, and applies 1t.
By accident, he NUDGES the KRAKEN MEDALLION, and knocks it off the bureau, and out the window.
Disappointed, he SHRUGS and continues with his tasks.

IN THE BALLROOM

Hennethica enters the deserted ballroom, to find Agrippa, alone, at its center.
Hennethica races up to him, and they saunter over to a window, near a BISTRO table.
Agrippa sets down Mennethica's glass, beside his own.
Hennethica raises the glasses -- returning Agrippa's, into his hand;
retaining the one of DR. MEADE'S potion, from the table.

HENNETHICA
It's a celebration to us!

Agrippa halts Hennethica's hand.

AGRIPPA
Hennethica... There is a chance you could die.
Would you do this for me?

They exchange looks.
Hennethica drinks!
And then --
They both drink...
Hennethica's hand GLOWS as he allows the black orb energy from the glass to ABSORB down into his stomach.
Excreting a black fluid onto the floor, down his thigh, he notices fingers INSIDE his stomach BEGIN to WRITHE.
Hennethica SMILES, and then succumbs to the pain, collapsing to the floor.
In awe, Agrippa reaches down, his hands OUT OF VIEW, as he RAISES a black lizzard, drenched in oily black liquid into our view. Its cries MIMIC the sounds of an infant.

AGRIPPA
A daughter is born to me!

HENNETHICA
It's a girl!

Agrippa REGARDS the reptile.

AGRIPPA
Bar-Hades!!

Hennethica again ACCEPTS the reptile into his arms.

Bar-Hades LEERS, through the window
Hennethica casts him the hairy eyeba!
He then indicates an adjacent room, beckoning a the young Shard guard -- Calidan!

AGRIPPA

AGRIPPA
Perhaps we could use this as an opportunity for training!

Calidan smiles!

A Shard soldier approaches, armed with a sword and helmet, and wearing Lance's chest armor!
Bar-Hades is eager to greet him, however the soldier attacks when Bar-Hades saunters too close, forcing her to flee!
She casts a quick flame upon him, and nearly burns the guard, before the others can extinguish it!
She eyes the armor, with distrust, and returns to Hennethica's side!
Hennethica performs a Clydesdale Promenade.
Bar-Hades clumsily emulates!
Hennethica kneels before Bar-Mades eye level, with a playful eye.

HENNETHICA
Mmm?

Bar-Mades huffs and dances, excited!
Hennethica smiles.
Hennethica turns and eyes a tiny beetle, laboring across a flower. Bar-Hades tries to emulate Hennethica.
The beetle offs the both of them with its middle finger!
Hennethica returns the look of a disapproving mother| Bar-Hades notices and shoots a puff of fire at the flower, singe-ing the beetle and sending him angrily on his way!
Hennethica then feels the ground RUMBLE He circles around, befuddled: Then realizing Bar-Hades has trippled in size!
The ground beneath them again TREMLBES.
Hennethica receives a chirp, on his comms.

AT THE NORTH RIDGE

A SNIPER draws a reticle on Lance, as Lance wades through the knee deep snow, only to find his path blocked by a snow drift! Lance tries in vain to wade or dig..

AT THE LEDGE

The spotter TAPS the sniper ON the shoulder, dismissive.

SNIPER SPOTTER

Where he's going, it's suicide Don't even waste your time.

AT THE NORTH RIDGE

Lance steps away, dispirited.

NEAR SHINOBA'S POSITION

As Lance travels along the ridge, Shinoba AMBUSHES, from above!
Shinoba closes the distance.
Lance steps under Shinoba, causing his momentum to send him forward, using it to toss him to the ground.
Shinoba recovers, stunned by the deft technique.

SHINOBA
Halt, Remnant!

Gusts of wind and snow woosh the mountainside.
Lance stands, freezing, before Shinoba.

SHINOBA
You're experiencing cold weather edema. The fluid will continue to fill your lungs. You'll be dead in an hour! I'll need the location of your nearest forward operating base; in exchange, I'll offer you a fresh oxygen supply.

They exchange looks.
Shinoba mutters into his comms!

SHINOBA

I'm sorry I am unable to comply with that order!!

Lance notices Shinoba secure a firm grip on his weapon. The others surround him
Lance steps back, stunned

AGRIPPA
what is Lieutenant Sheeran up too??

ERICMAIN
He made his presence known, at Essex Junction.
That was an uncharacteristic error, being he still needs to establish a logistical presence.

AGRIPPA
A logistical presence... Meaning he'll try to establish his supply lines.

They exchange looks.

ERICMAIN
Or he could compromise ours! We share a lot of the same technologyl We're established -- it's faster, and efficient.
And it's not what anyone would expect him to do!

Agrippa paces for a moment.

AGRIPPA
Yes. That sounds more inline with his thinking. (then)
But why ford so deep into the Swat Valley, through the heart of our best fortification, only to claim the North Shore? It's a savannah!
Why ignore the lithium mines??

ERICMAIN
Truly, it is a questionable tactic.

AGRIPPA
A wasted opportunity, perhaps; and yet a formidable show of force! He has a powerful ally. One, we have not yet seen!

He turns to the commander, concerned.

AGRIPPA
Contact our top security commander -- Shinoba. I want to gather my strongest warriors to fortify our presence in the lithium mines.

ERICMAIN
I've been unable to reach him!!

A sign sits above the equipment.

INSERT: HIGGS BOSON == GOD PARTICLE!

Lance observes integral equations on a nearby whiteboard. He tries to decipher them.

DR. MEADE
Could you hand me that pipette!

Surprised, Lance notices him and complies. Then notes the glass tubes, lining the counters.

LANCE
What does all of this do?

Dr. Meade smiles.

DR. MEADE
This equipment suspends the state of entropy, inside the tube.

LANCE
...Entropy.

DR. MEADE
Yes! Entropy! The state of decay. This tube slows it, allowing us time to analyze its contents!

LANCE
You work for Agrippa.

DR. MEADE
Oh dear no! Though he supports my research!!
As a science officer, in the Federation, I was limited a great deal.
But on this world, in this lab... and because of the war -- I now have unlimited resources.

His smile gains Lance's full attention! 
Dr. Meade sobers. He INSPECTS Lance's credentials:

He holds up a mirror, which Lance gazes Into: Initially, of his own reflection, and then of the Ibra-Lim, behind him, as Dr. Meade TILTS the mirror!
Stunned, Lance spins!
The Ibra-Lim can now hear and see Lance, his coverings having been removed.

DR. MEADE
Thank You! And now a voice sample!

LANCE
What? What did you do to him?

Dr. Meade holds a tiny spring up to the Ibra-Lim's ear, he squeezes it, and it makes emits a low sound: SNAP!
Lance regards Dr. Meade, befuddled.

DR. MEADE
Thank you! 
(then)
That man is very sick.

Lance regards Dr. Meade, with suspicion...! He speaks, under his breath.

LANCE
(Soto) Dr. Meade?!

Dr. Meade's eyes bounce about, betraying his identity.

DR. MEADE
No... I'm afraid he's not here!!

TELLUMUS
He's lying Lance, run!

SHADOWCASTER
Lance, please, run; you need to run!!

Dr. Meade holds up a navy index card!

They exchange looks.

DR. MEADE
Focus, Here, please.

Dr. Meade then removes the index card from Lance's view, and places a small red gummy candy in his hand!
They exchange looks.
Dr. Meade snaps THE spring -- now hidden, behind his back!
In an instant, Lance's left-hand SNAPS to his weapon!!
Dr. Meade beams!

DR. MEADE
Oh! Good reflexes, indeed!
(Resolute, Soto)
Yes, this must be done!
You will be a challenge for him!

Dr. Meade now studies Lance, with intent. He then notices Lance's expired credentials!

DR. MEADE
Your credentials are expired!
Perhaps you don't belong here. Hmm?!
You are obviously not an engineer
Your face is familiar though.

Dr. Meade grabs his notebooks and exits.

SHADOWCASTER
Lance, it's Dr. Meade, you must not let him get away!!

DR. MEADE
It was nice meeting you...
(O.S., Soto) Lance Rhovonidin!!

Lance draws his weapon and persues!
// DR. MEADE evades Lance //

IN THE MAIN CORRIDOR

Papers fly out of Dr. Meade's binder.
Lance PURSUES him, to the end of the darkened corridor - Dr. Meade vanishes IN the shadows!

DR. MEADE
(0.S.) The Federation sent you, indeed. Haven't they?
..Lance Rhovonidinl And you, in your folly, have attempted to follow me...
Are you in pursuit of my research?? 

Lance peers around and through the shadows.
He then HEARS a LOW, GUTTURAL GROWL, in the shadows!

DR. MEADE
(O.S.) Your legacy ends here!

Lance notices talons, and then large coarse black hairs - - BRISTLING, as a large gritty - BAR HADES, rises out of the shadows! I
The oversized Bar-Hades careens and follows him through a lab!!

FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR

Lance SMASHES through a wall, collapsing in the corridor! Bar-Hades, closes behind!
Bar-Hades easily fends off Lance's underpowered attacks.
He LEERS and disables The Remnant, Leviathan, and The Kraken Medallions!
He decimates the floor, and they collapse through!

INT. THE ULTRADAM - THE CAVERN OF THE UNDERGROUND - DAY

Lance and Bar-Mades collapse and smash into the unlit underground!
Bar-Hades deflects Lance's advances and tail-whips into a perimeter ledge, inflicting heavy damage!
Lance is nearly unable to recover!
He realizes a hidden staircase and ascends it!
// Hennethica ascends to the crown //

EXT. THE TAIGA PLAINS - THE EPIC MOUNTAIN - DAY

The steep mountain cliffside is dotted by a tiny opening, leading out to nowhere but the ground a thousand meters, below!

ON THE TUNDRA HILLS

Hennethica, Agrippa, and other Shard conduct battle formations.

BACK TO SCENE

Lance exits through the tiny opening in the mountains and scrambles up the steep mountain cliffside, climbing above the Epic waterfall; Bar-hades smashes through and PERSUES

ON THE TUNDRA HILLS

The SUDDEN VIOLENCE draws the attention of Agrippa, and his troops.

BACK TO SCENE

Lance slips and plummets past Bar-Hades, down the mountainside... I
As he strikes the water, he falls beyond Bar-Mades range and SUMMONS The Leviathan!!
The sea creature extends itself, and Lance falls into its embrace!

VIctorlous, but now severely weakened, Bar-Hades returns her attention to Lance.
Lance performs another deadly strike!

ON THE TUNDRA HILLS

Hennethica, and General Agrippa, WATCH, in horror -- unable to come to the aid of their daughter!

BACK TO SCENE

Lance executes a mortal hit, and Bar-Hades is unable to recover!

IN DR. MEADE'S LAB

The Ibra-Lim, its eyes wide and unblinking, TUMBLES through the rubble, within its sarcophagus, until it settles in the rubble.

IN THE CORRIDOR

Dr. Meade loses his footing, and the corridor collapses away. Fearful, he falls into the darkness!

ON THE TUNDRA HILLS

Hennethica, General Agrippa, and others WATCH, in horror, as the Ultradam collapses, crumbling down the mountainside, remnants of it swallowed by the Epic Waterfall...

INTERCUT: The Power grid fails, across the island-continent; The Remnant Cheerill...

ON THE TUNDRA HILLS

Tears well IN Agrippa's eyes...

IN THE RUBBLE

The Ibra-Lim summons a vision of Dr. Meade standing again in the UltraDam's peaceful grand corridor.
His back to us, drawing closer to him, until realizing us behind. He ejects a condescending laugh.
The Ibra-Lim MIMICS his laugh.
The Ibra-Lim's glowing eyes shut.

BACK TO SCENE:

Lance RECOVERS, out of the rubble
Tellumus stands by his side.
Agrippa and Lance exchange hard looks.
Federation soldiers scramble to Lance's side, radio-ing into shoulder comms, when Agrippa is spotted!

FEDERATION SOLDIER ONE
(Into his comms) Red Eagle has been spotted; acknowledge.

FEDERATION SOLDIER NUMBER TWO
(O.S., Filtered) Red Eagle -- spotted; confirm?! Predator forces are en route...

They turn and head back down the mountainside!

TELLUMUS
Lance! No! Not here!! We are still within lethal range of his archers.

CRISIS [3.1.4] Sheeran confronts King Agrippa In the HighDem mountains
// Sheeran has a final meeting, before attempting to persue Agrippa //

INT. THE SHEERAN HIDDEN COMMAND CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Captain Zargieffe, Lieutenant Sheeran, and Captain Kawamura sit shoulder to shoulder at a covered fold-out table, facing three Federation brigades. with the exception of the lieutenant, all PRIME their weapons.
Sheeran stands!

SHEERAN
We have located the whereabouts of General Agrippa -- here, on The Tundra Hills!

He indicates the coordinates on a 3D table map of the island-continent.

SHEERAN
We have forces, presently engaging; awaiting our reinforcement! 
You are to follow corporal Lance Rhovonidin into the Underground Realm 
which leads into the Walled Metropolis to block the escape of this man.
Captains Zargieffe, Kawamura and I, will confront him from the East, 
drawing him into the heart of our ranks, should he flee.

He circles toward the other side of the room.

SHEERAN
Ladies and gentlemen, this fugitive is dangerous.
I expect to take casualties.
Hopefully, not substantial!
You are dismissed.

IN THE CORRIDOR

The federation soldiers exit the meeting, dispirited,

IN THE BATHROOM

A handful of Federation soldiers filter in. They huddle and WHISPER among themselves!

FEARFUL SOLDIER NUMBER ONE
Lieutenant Sheeran is Insane!

FEARFUL SOLDIER NUMBER TWO
You said it!

FEARFUL SOLDIER NUMBER THREE
I agree; he needs to be stopped... or we're all effin dead...

A bathroom stall swings open: Captain Kawamura!
They HUSH!
Kawamura approaches the sink, and sanitizes his hands, bathing them under the water.
They eye him, uncomfortable. As he exits, he holds the door open for another man whom enters:
Captain Strausburg!!
He heads toward themll Their hands lower, anxious, toward their weapons!

STRAUSBURG
Relax, gentlemen! I'm here to help!

He reveals his badge, and reveals his rank: equal to Lieutenant Sheeran!

STRAUSBURG
Disregard everything you heard in that meeting!
Our orders are to arrest and detain Federation Vice Lieutenant Sheeran, for crimes against humanity, after we locate general Agrippa.
We are to escort general Agrippa back to The Federation Forward Command Station, so that he can testify against Lieutenant Sheeran, bearing witness to these crimes. 
(then)
Return to your baraks, now. And be ready to take action, once I give the order, to physically overtake Lieutenant Sheeran, once General Agrippa is in our custody.

The fearful soldiers' smile, relieved! 
They nod, grateful, and exit.
Strausburg, now tense, wipes the sweat from his face and gazes into a mirror.
He sets down his badge and firearm onto the wash counter, and enters a bathroom stall.

Lieutenant Sheeran enters and approaches the wash counter, his badge also now visible on his uniform through the mirror.
He examines and preens his appearance.
He glances, down, and notices the badge, matching his own, next to the pistol.
His eyes jump toward the stalls!
He returns his attention to the countertop, stunned and with thoughts, racing!

EXT. THE TAIGA PLAINS - DAY

GUNFIRE and TUMULT emanate from an opening to an underground cavern.

FIFTY of Sheeran hardened Federation soldiers break away from him, and disappear over hilltop.

Sheeran and his two remaining loyal captsins exchange stern looks as they enmask and inspect their body armor.

SHEERAN
(Filtered) Keep in mind, gentleman, this man is dangerous. Be carefull!

// Agrippa flees into the cavernous underground
Sheeran SIGNALS for the machine-gunner station - his man sets up his gun station at the intersection of a corridor.
As the gunner chambers a round, Agrippa leaps from the corridor, only to be met by his gunfire!

Agrippa DEFLECT the barrage of rounds, using his shield and starts to close the distance!

Sheeran INTERCEDES, striking Agrippa and firing a round that misses his head, forcing Agrippa to retreat into the shadows!

Sheeran SIGNALS for another machine-gunner station at the intersection of the next corridor!
He advances. His aim, steady!

Three Shard soldiers persue Sheeran, as he dips around a corner, but are surprised when he returns, firing off three quick rounds -- killing the closest guard;
then two more, mortally wounding the second, planting a solitary round in the chest of the third. Sheeran manages to escape.

Sheeran spots an A-hole, gloating on a far of ledge, well out of Sheeran's range (he thinks!)

The A-Hole bounds up and down, smiling towards his direction...

Sheeran lifts his weapon and fires, and watches the A-hole drop!!

IN THE NEXT CHAMBER 

A Shard soldiers spots Kawamura straffing across the corridor and unleashes gunfire in his direction. 
Kawamura locks his barrel on him, performs a forward monkey roll in midst of the rounds 
and then drops him with a round to the chest and then the soldier's head!!

Following close, in a SWITCHBACK PURSUIT, Sheeran fires TWO rounds into a Shard man's chest, 
and then uses the man's body as a shield as he kicks his way through a door.

IN THE NEXT CORRIDOR

The man's body takes three rounds and falls as Sheeran returns fire and hits a Shard soldier. He advances, shifting laterally - left then right, 
and then fires another quick three rounds into a frustrated then fearful Shard soldier whom fails to draw a bead on him,
and another volley into a disoriented Shard soldier, behind him.

Sheeran draws a bead on Agrippa, but an A-Hole grips away the barrel of his weapon!

SHEERAN
What-the??

Sheeran regrips the A-Hole's wrist, in frustration, and then
KICKS him away and FIRES - miss!, as the A-Hole ducks into a corridor!

Agrippa disappears to safety.

Anothe A-Hole reaches for the ammo, equipped to his waist Sheeran grabs his wrist, and drops his leg across the A-Hole's elbow, pinning him to the ground!

SHEERAN
Goddamn A-Hole!

Sheeran FIRES seven rounds into him, and another THREE ROUND BURST into an A-Hole spilling into the corridor. Watching as he falls, and then returning his aim onto the corridors.
Agrippa LEAPS from one of the corridors, Sheeran deflects his descending weapon, but fails to land a center-mass round, as Agrippa bops his hand upward and away. Sheeran recovers.
Agrippa vanishes into an adjacent corridor. 

Sheeran LISTENS to small ARMS fire, and the CLANG of weapons, which then dies away.

FEDERATION SOLDIERS 
Sir!! We're here for you!

SHEERAN
(Sotto) Shit! Now I'll never get the chance to kill you!

Sheeran glowers in silence as seven Federation soldiers step into view.

CURIOUS SOLDIER
What was that, sir??

He and Sheeran exchange looks.
Sheeran indicates a corridor!

SHEERAN
Nothing. Go that way; he'll most likely be in there.

Kawamura DIPS around the corner, and fires! Unawares, as Agrippa has already outflanked him.
He SWINGS and decapitates him!!

Sheeran backs away, stunned!

Agrippa scrutinizes Sheeran's REMAINING soldiers, and then recedes into an adjacent corridor.

AGRIPPA
You will never have the soldiers, or firepowwer to finish me!

Sheeran retreats around a corner and shoves off his subzero gear!

General Agrippa reveals his shadow, around a corner, refusing to surrender!

Lieutenant Sheeran CLOCKS A GLANCE, as Lieutenant Strausburg passes a signal to his Federation soldiers!
His eyes narrow!

SHEERAN
General Agrippa, you may think yourself a hero, in your own mind, 
but you have violated promises you made to the Allied Federation. 
Promises you made by oath.
(then)
Don't you miss home?? Lets end this Here! And now! 
Lets consider everything that occurred at the command station -- water under the bridge!
Surrender! Lets get you home, and get you reinstated!

IN A HIDDEN CORRIDOR

A flurry of emotions flood General Agrippa's face; he is troubled.

IN THE CORRIDOR

General Agrippa steps into the open...

Sheeran lowers his weapon, as his remaining turn to him, stunned:
He raises his left hand, revealing a bright & blinking DETONATOR!!

CAPTAIN NUMBER ONE
My God!! It's a K-9 detonator!

CAPTAIN NUMBER TWO
K-9? We don't carry that on any Federation ships; its only carried on warships...

They turn to Agrippa... -- also dumbfounded!

STRAUSBURG
(Hinting) But you can account for the missing K-9, on your ship's manifest!

Agrippa NODS!

STRAUSBURG
(Hinting) Then we'll have to bring you in, Agrippa, so you can explain...

As Strausburg approaches Agrippa, Sheeran shoots Strausburg in the back of the head!
Stunned, an able-bodied soldier attacks Sheeran, and is also shot!

SHEERAN
Agrippa... you may think The Federation is the problem... You're wrong!!--

He depresses the detonator, and The Sheeran Hidden Command Base, a few miles in the BACKGROUND, EXPLODES!

AT THE SHEEERAN HIDDEN COMMAND BASE

Federation soldiers, and all escape pods, are destroyed!

BACK TO SCENE

The corridor crumbles...

Lieutenant Sheeran seethes!

SHEERAN
You are way too dangerous to be allowed off this Island-World, alive... or dead.

Fearful, General Agrippa retreats to the center of the corridor!

SHEERAN
The last time we met, I was sitting behind a desk when you struck me.
I assure you things will go differently!

He motions for his men to surround Agrippa.
Agrippa lowers, and flexes, like a puma!
The soldiers pounce! Agrippa denies each, one-by-one, until Sheeran penetrates, 
and delivers a blow to Agrippa, which drops him to the ground, out of breath.

Sheeran circles Agrippa!

SHEERAN
You think because I sit behind a desk, you don't have to obey my orders;
You think because I sit behind a desk, you don't have to respect my decisions!
That you don't have to obey!

Sheeran strikes Agrippa, again!

SHEERAN
--I am your superior. In every way. I have earned every one of my stripes!!
I've put in my time. You seem to have misplaced this fact.

Agrippa collapses to a knee, exhausted.
Sheeran KICKS Agrippa to the floor, separating him from his weapons!

SHEERAN
You started a war, Edwin Agrippa; you defied me!

AGRIPPA
Yes.

SHEERAN
Why?!

AGRIPPA
To defend the honor of a friend.

The Federation soldier lower their heads, affected.

SHEERAN
Really??

...Sheeran then PUMPS two rounds into Agrippa's torso, which then penetrate deep into a nearby wall!
Agrippa dips into a corridor, and evades his shadow!
Feeling duped, Agrippa retreats further from his view
Resistant, the Federation soldiers' digest his words.

SHEERAN
You rebels will pay for what you've done, and that strange little man, Hennethica.

AGRIPPA
--Keep her name out of your mouth.

They exchange looks.

SHEERAN
(Dumbfounded)...you -- I (Snickers) What?! Is that what this is about?
Your friend? Standing up for a friend??
Hah! You and that she-man, Hennethica...

Agrippa bounds off the wall, at Sheeran!
Sheeran nods to his men, expectant... but they do not open fire! Allowing Agrippa to strike Sheeran to the floor.
The surrounding Federation soldiers step away, refusing to intercede.
Irritated, Sheeran spits grit from his teeth.

AGRIPPA
Keep Hennethica's name out of your mouth!

Sheeran again draws to his feet!

SHEERAN
You defied me, Agrippa! People have died! Giving their lives in contribution to this effort.

Sheeran swings at Agrippa! A royal haymaker!
Agrippa ducks and takes hold of Sheeran's sidearm, inadvertant forcing him to eject four rounds into the floor!

AGRIPPA
Then surrender. Or resign, if you're so deeply moved!

With a headbutt, Sheeran separates himself from Agrippa!
Agrippa recoils. He sweeps Sheeran to the floor, and then lands a flurry of punches!
Sheeran is too weary to return to his feet.

SHEERAN
(Sneers) The Remnant will finish what I've started! They will not be bargained with.

AGRIPPA
Perhaps. Was it you who summoned the star-killer?

They exchange looks.

SHEERAN
Star-killer... -- What are you talking about?!

Sheeran gapes toward the skies, noticing the star-killer moon, high in the sky.

SHEERAN
What-the-hell-is... -- that-is-not-part-of-my-plan!!

The Hurt of betrayal fill Sheeran's eyes!

EXT. THE OCEAN WORLD - FEDERATION SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - FLASHBACK

Judge Augustus observes Sheeran's RAMBLING. Chief's eyes are skeptical.

BACK TO SCENE

Hurt and betrayal fill Sheeran's eyes!

SHEERAN
(Somber) Very clever!

AGRIPPA
It was never your intention... for anyone to leave this planet!

SHEERAN 
Wh.. -- Mmph!

AGRIPPA
That star-killer base is a violation of the Neutral Stance--

SHEERAN
--There is no Neutral Stancel! Agrippa! 
I was never here to arrest you... Agrippa.

Sheeran's men gape!
Sheeran stands and points to Agrippa.

He pulls the trigger of his rifle. The hollow CLICK of the hammer against the chamber causes Agrippa to shudder.

Sheeran lowers his weapon, disappointed. He PACES in front of Agrippa.

SHEERAN
Fire your weapons upon this man! Now! Kill him!

The soldiers lower their weapons, defiant.

SHEERAN
Murder him!

He returns his attention to Agrippa.

SHEERAN
This man is a threat to the Federation. Do you not see that?!--

AGRIPPA
--At every turn, you are defeated! Even now.

Lieutenant reels at the multiple levels of betrayal.

EXT. THE OCEAN WORLD - FEDERATION SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - FLASHBACK

Captain Augustus listens to Sheeran's RAMBLINGS, his eyes -- skeptical.

BACK TO SCENE

SHEERAN
(Somber) Very clever!

General Agrippa wields his weapon... and then uses it to snatch the rank away from Sheeran's uniform!

Lieutenant Sheeran's eyes water, enraged and embarrassed.

Sheeran KNEELS before the downed captain and DRAWS his firearm and fires two rounds which land, firm, in Agrippa's lungs. He falls.

SHEERAN
That's enough from you!

The federation soldiers' raise their weapons!

UNIFIED SOLDIERS
Drop your weapon! Drop your weapon, now! Obey the order! Or you will be fired upon!--

Sheeran stand and confronts them.

SHEERAN
--I will do no such thing! I will do no such thing!! You do not have the jurisdiction or the Federation authority to detain me!! 
(then)
Die, all you -- DIE!
(then)
Mutiners!

They exchange fire!

Sheeran reels as the force of the impacts carries him backwards towards the cliff. 
As he attempts to speak through his mortal wounds, 
the nanite living cells in Sheeran's cells begin to heal his body...

The four Fearful Federation soldiers', in front of General Agrippa, fall, dead.

SHEERAN
One thing you continue to underestimate about me, Agrippa: I always win!

Sheeran's head lowers, and he dies.


Surviving soldiers tend to one other, and Agrippa!

SOLDIER
General...are you okay, sir??

They exchange looks. A hidden communication. Agrippa smiles.

AGRIPPA
Let's put an end to this war!

Schwartzman, a Federation Captain steps forward.

SCHWARTZMAN
Edwin Agrippa, by decree of The Federation, and with Federation Vice Lieutenant Edgar Peter Rhaimis Sheeran, as my witness...
I hereby reinstate you to the office and station of General of The Federation!

As they raise Agrippa, on a shoulder, Ericmain inspects Agrippa's chest wound: It's morta!

ERICHAIN
Sir, how can we help you??

AGRIPPA
Quickly! Get me to the ante-chamber!

The Draz-Ghoul fights its way, through awakening gunnery, hidden throughout the trees, making its way towards Lance!
Lance FENDS off the remaining Draz-Ghoul; executing a properly timed counter to the Ultrawolf's attack!
In anger, the ferile animal STUMBLES back then circles. It GNARLS and GNASHES Its teeth, SAVORING the scent of Lance's flesh.
The SOUND of their fisticuffs ATTRACTS a Metropolis guard.
The Ultrawolf retreats into the shadows, his fierce eyes trained on Lance.
Lance OVERTAKES the absent-minded guard, LANDING a resounding MINSTREL to the back OF his head. The man collapses.
Lance COMMANDEERs his wardrobe, leaving the naked man tucked away in the sewer.

LANCE
Is there noone who can challenge me?!

The Ultrawolf's eyes remain fixed on Lance, and then he steps away: We will finish this fight another day!

Hand Weapon fortification materials; Guard stations-, routes- and scheduled shift-changes; NFC RFID access keycards.

The guards spot him!
He SUMMONS The Twelve Remnant and vanquishes the twenty of them.
The doors lock behind as the remaining, retreat inside.
Instead of summoning The Kraken to smash through the entrance, Lance analyzes the metropolis command center walls. He STARTS to climb them.

ON A NARROW LEDGE

As Lance navigates the narrow ledge, towards an opposite annex of the building, he battles archers, ensconced in the corners, and spear-throwing guards, on the ground!
The gunnery stations perched within the tree canopies take notice but do not fire.
He climbs further up the walls, searching for an accessible window. He dodges ten point eight three two millimeter rounds - fired, from inside the building.
The rounds shatter a picture window allowing him to enter!

Lance remembers his exchange with Dr. Meade, and the hidden spring, the index cards, and the Ibra-Lim...
