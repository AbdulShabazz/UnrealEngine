- [ ] Lt. Sheeran is a nanite machine, powered by lithium iron phosphate which the planet cultivates naturally. Very small amounts replenish his armor and energy. What could an entire planet's worth transform him into? Dr. Meade reveals a flaw to Agrippa that the Federation hid regarding his immortality proof. Agrippa urges him to revise the proof and gives him the resources to fix it.
- [ ] Lance (Moveset) - Thine Eternal Hellfire - As a result of highly coordinated combat, Lance can assume the identity of any of The Remnant whom follow him, reinvigorating his HP/LP, bringing his entire moveset with the exception of his most powerful finishers.
- [ ] SUGGESTION: Include a supporting playable character (ShadowCaster?) to portray the gun battles and firefights to more cleanly intermingle the genres.
- [ ] Players drive Lance into encounters which he dominates against tougher and tougher more capable opponents  
- [ ] Offer new player gear, skins, re-assignable custom movesets and soundtracks  
- [ ] Use the max (overpowered) player levels to test play-through the game (remember, this is a feature!)  
- [ ] Lance (new moveset): Scrum Lord - Lance overtakes a massive ring of entangled opponents
